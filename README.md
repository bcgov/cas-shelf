# Google Cloud Storage - Terraform API-driven workflow

Terraform Enterprise API scripts located in folder `tfe-scripts` helps create a new workspace with the initial configuration, folder `bcgov`
and user-defined configure variables, folder `variables`.

## Steps

### Install Tools

1. Install [`asdf`](https://asdf-vm.com/#/core-manage-asdf-vm?id=install-asdf-vm).
1. Install required tools via `asdf` (the versions are defined in `.tool-versions`).

```bash
make install_asdf_tools
```

### Set TF Cloud Token as an environment variable

1. Create a new Team token via [`Settings > Teams > Team API Token`](https://app.terraform.io/app/thebuttonclan/settings/teams).

1. Set environment variable `TFC_TOKEN` for tfe scripts.

```bash
export TFC_TOKEN=<team-token>
```

### Create a Service Account key for GCS and get the Credentials file
1. Navigate to the Google Cloud Platform API Console.
1. Select a project or create a new project.
1. Navigate to IAM & Admin > Service Accounts page.
1. Select a Service Account or create a new Service Account.
   - The Service Account requires the roles `Storage Admin`, `Create Service Accounts`, `Delete Service Accounts`, and `Service Account Key Admin`.
1. Create a Service Account key as JSON and download it named `credentials.json` in the root directory.

### Create a new workspace and upload configuration files

```bash
make create_workspace org=<my-team> workspace=<my-workspace>
```

- It skips creating a new one if the specified name of workspace already exists.
- It compresses the main TF script folder `bcgov` and uploads to the workspace (non-VCS).
- It sets placeholder variables from `variables` folder.

### Set variable values

1. Copy `example.values` file to `.values` file.
1. Set each value in `.values` file.

   - `credentials_file`: the credentials file path of Google Cloud service account
   - `kubernetes_host`: the hostname of Openshift cluster
   - `kubernetes_token`: the authentication token of Openshift cluster
     - Use [`Service Account Tokens`](https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/3.5/rest_api/index.html#rest-api-serviceaccount-tokens) instead of `Session Tokens`, which is expiring within 24 hours by default.
   - `kubernetes_namespaces`: the list of Openshift namespaces to run jobs
   - `namespace_apps`: the list of namespace and app name pairs of Openshift cluster

1. Run TFE script to set the variables on TFC workspace.

```bash
make set_values org=<my-team> workspace=<my-workspace>
```

### Trigger Run command to performs a plan & apply

```bash
make run org=<my-team> workspace=<my-workspace>
```

- It sets `Apply Method` to `Auto apply` on workspace creation to skip manual user confirmations after planning in terms of API-driven run workflow.

### Other commands

```bash
make sync_values org=<my-team> workspace=<my-workspace> # it downloads the current variable values from the workspace
make destroy org=<my-team> workspace=<my-workspace> # it destroys all resources created by the workspace
make delete_workspace org=<my-team> workspace=<my-workspace> # it deletes the workspace
```

- `sync` command is useful to sync variable `namespace_apps` value because it gets updated during deployment process.
- It is highly recommended to run `destroy` command to remove resources before deleting a workspace.

### How to provision a new bucket for a new app during deployment process
- In the process of setting variable values `.values`, it also creates Secret Objects containing Terraform Cloud workspace credentials in each Openshift namespace.
- In Github tag push events, CI (CircleCI) publishes images encapsulating one of the TFC API script to provision a new app.
   - https://github.com/bcgov/cas-shelf/packages/193931
- There is `kubernetes job task` in a sub-directory `openshift` > `deploy` > `job`, which runs the image on Openshift cluster using the TFC workspace Secret Objet.
   - it requires one string argument includes namespace and app name separated by comma, `"namespace,app"` in `command` job attribute.

### Docker image tag convention
- It uses Sementic Versioning [`SemVer`](https://semver.org/) in order to attach a meaning to a version number or the change.
- It publishes 4(+) different versions of images based on `Git Tag` to support flexible `version range` to users.
   - e.g. `git tag 1.2.3-rc2`
      - `<image-url>:1`
      - `<image-url>:1.2`
      - `<image-url>:1.2.3`
      - `<image-url>:1.2.3-rc2`
      - Image tags above point at the same image after pushing them.
